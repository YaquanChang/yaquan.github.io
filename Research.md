My research experience mainly refers to the Macroecology, Remote Sensing, and ecological models. I focus on the selection process, asking why there am familiar with R and Matlab, and have some basic experience in Fortran.

## Macroecology
#### taxon based species distribution model
I did my bachelor thesis and a paper to investigate whether modeled habitat suitability could explain structural characteristics in balsam fir donminated stand. I used _species distribution models_ to simulate habitat suitability and trying to relate field based site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG).

In my master Rural Landscape course, my group and I did an Upgraded Action Plan for the the invisive species Giant Hogweed in Vordingborg Municipality. I used species distribution model to simulate where is suitable for Giant Hogweed to grow then we did a field work to valided it and finally we made a practical action plan to eradicate them.
