I am currently a master canadiate in Nature Management at University of Copenhagen. I broadly interested in plant biogeography, macroecology, especially in Anthropocene! Now I am working on how land use intensity have impact on the plant functional diversity in Europe. I am trying to investigate how human play roles in selection process (e.g., environmental filtering, limiting similarity). I am using taxon-free methods based on functional traits, since taxon-free metrics can often be related to environmental parameters with statistical significance, they offer opportunities for understanding which kinds of species are likely to thrive in which regions as biota adjust to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Moveover, functional traits like common currency like linking different scales (e.g., phenotypic, ecological or metabolic).
