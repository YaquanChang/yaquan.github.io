My research experience mainly refers to Macroecology, Remote Sensing, and ecological models. I focus on the selection process, asking how human have impacts on functional diversity. I am familiar with R and Matlab, and have some basic knowledge of Fortran.

### How human have impacts on functional diversity?
In my master thesis, I am going to investigate how human have impacts on functional diversity. Before my master thesis, I did a project out of course scope to investigate the similar question but only based on Gribskov, Denmark. I used _LiDAR_ and field derived variables to capture the functional diversity and found the LiDAR-derived variables have slightly better performances.

#### Output:
**Yaquan Chang**. LiDAR-derived variables as a proxy for functional diversity of woody plant and response to forest management intensity, 2019, _Project out of course scope_ 

### What else can species distribution model tell us?
I did my bachelor thesis and a paper to investigate whether modeled habitat suitability could explain structural characteristics in balsam fir dominated stand. I used _species distribution models_ to simulate habitat suitability and trying to relate field-based site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG). 

#### Output: 
**Yaquan Chang**, Charles P.-A. Bourque. Relating modelled habitat suitability for Abies Balsamea to on the ground species structural characteristics in naturally growing forests, 2019 _Ecological Indicators_ (In revision)

### An Upgraded Action Plan for invasive species
In my master Rural Landscape course, my group and I did an Upgraded Action Plan for the invasive species Giant Hogweed in Vordingborg Municipality. I used species distribution model to simulate where is suitable for Giant Hogweed to grow then we did fieldwork to validate it, and finally, we made a practical action plan to eradicate them.

#### Output
**Yaquan Chang**, Alfred Figueras Anton, Oriol García Antúnez, Andreas Davidsen, Jens Lindgaard. 2019. How to upgrade current management plans for the invasive species Giant Hogweed in Denmark – a case study from Vordingborg municipality, Zealand. The Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) Scientific Student Conference. Uppsala, Sweden (Poster presentation) and paper (In prep)


### Remote Sensing including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
I am crazy about Remote Sensing approach since it really convenient researchers to investigate on a larger scale. I tried LiDAR and UAV products. I used the LiDAR-derived variable to predict functional diversity (see the first topic). I also learnt a bit about the UAV approach. We compared the performance of different platforms when processing UAV data.

#### Output
Haozhou Wang, **Yaquan Chang**, Chuan Li, Qiurong Liu, Min Zhong, Qinxuan Chen. 2017. Analysis of Imagine Capacity in Resources Survey between Two UAV Photogrammetry Softwares: PIX 4D Mapper and Photoscan. Gansu Science and Technology. 33(22): 46-51 (In Chinese) [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/UAV_Paper.pdf)


### Forest dynamics
I learnt the basic concept of the forest dynamic model when I was an undergraduate student. I ran a process-based dynamic global vegetation model called Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ model) and calculated water use efficiency (WUE) of the forest in the Yangtze River basin. 

#### Output
