Research is not a closed box, and researchers’ ideas should not be limited to academic circles. Scientists should play a pivotal role not only concerning the creation of knowledge but also regarding the transfer of knowledge. However, language barriers are one of impediments to knowledge transfer. This is why I decided to work as a volunteer editor for Wiley Ecology China Wechat account, summarizing papers published by Wiley and translating them into Chinese to make findings available for a broader Chinese-speaking audience - scientists as well as practitioners. I have published several blogs on the Chinese social media platform “Wechat”, for one of which I received the “Top-5 Award” since the article was among the five most frequently viewed blog entries in September 2019. Please take a look at these blogs (Sorry it is only in Chinese).
