I am currently a master candidate in Nature Management at the University of Copenhagen. I am broadly interested in plant biogeography, macroecology, and functional ecology. I am using taxon-free methods based on functional traits since taxon-free metrics could help understanding which kinds of species are likely to survive in the specific area and adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions (i.e., environmental filtering). Moreover, functional traits like common currency linking different scales (e.g., phenotypic, ecological or metabolic) and play a pivotal role in relating ecosystem function to biodiversity. Thus, what drives functional diversity and how it affects ecosystem function are my main interests. I am also interested in applying remote sensing into functional ecology as it is convenient for researchers investigating at larger scales. Now I am working on how land-use intensity have impacts on the plant functional diversity in Denmark, trying to investigate how human play roles in the ecological process.
