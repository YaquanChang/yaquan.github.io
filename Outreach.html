Now, I am working for Wiley Ecology China as a volunteer editor. My job is to summarize paper which has been published by Wiley and translate them into Chinese. I think it is cool since it is an excellent way to spread new findings and raise people's concern about the environment! We published these blogs in Chinese social media called Wechat. Please take a look at these blogs (Sorry it is only in Chinese).
