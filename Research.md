My research experience mainly refers to the Macroecology, Remote Sensing, and ecological models. I focus on the selection process, asking why there am familiar with R and Matlab, and have some basic experience in Fortran.

### How human have impact on the functional diversity?
In my master thesis I am going to invistgate how huam have impact on the functional diversity. Before my master thesis, I did an project out of course scope to invegative the samiliar question but only based on Gribskov, Denmark. I used _LiDAR_ and field derived variables to capture the functional diversity and found the LiDAR derived variables have slightly better performances.

#### Output:
LiDAR-derived variables as a proxy for functional diversity of woody plant and response to forest management intensity, 2019, _Project out of course scope_ [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/Project_Yaquan.pdf)


### What else can species distribution model tell us?
I did my bachelor thesis and a paper to investigate whether modeled habitat suitability could explain structural characteristics in balsam fir donminated stand. I used _species distribution models_ to simulate habitat suitability and trying to relate field based site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG). 

#### Output: 
**Yaquan Chang**, Charles P.-A. Bourque. Relating modelled habitat suitability for Abies Balsamea to on the ground species structural characteristics in naturally growing forests, 2019 _Ecological Indicators_ (In revision)

### An Upgraded Action Plan for invisive species
In my master Rural Landscape course, my group and I did an Upgraded Action Plan for the the invisive species Giant Hogweed in Vordingborg Municipality. I used species distribution model to simulate where is suitable for Giant Hogweed to grow then we did a field work to valided it and finally we made a practical action plan to eradicate them.

##### Output
Report [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/Giant_Hogweed.pdf)


### Remote Sensing including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
I am crazy about Remote Sensing approach since it really convinent researchers to investigate in a larger scale. I tried LiDAR and UAV products. I used LiDAR-derived variable to predict the functional diversity (see first topic). I also learnt a bit about the UAV approach. We compared the performance of different platforms when processing UAV data.

#### Output
Haozhou Wang, **Yaquan Chang**, Chuan Li, Qiurong Liu, Min Zhong, Qinxuan Chen. 2017. Analysis of Imagine Capacity in Resources Survey between Two UAV Photogrammetry Softwares: PIX 4D Mapper and Photoscan. Gansu Science and Technology. 33(22): 46-51 (In Chinese)

### Forest dynamics
I learnt the basic concept of forest dynamic model when I was a undergraduate student. I ran a process-based dynamic global vegetation model called Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ model) and calculated water use efficiency (WUE) of the forest in the Yangtze River basin.
