I am currently a master candidate in Nature Management at the University of Copenhagen. I am broadly interested in plant biogeography, macroecology, especially in Anthropocene! Now I am working on how land-use intensity have impacts on the plant functional diversity in Europe. I am trying to investigate how human play roles in the ecological process. I am using taxon-free methods based on functional traits since taxon-free metrics could help understanding which kinds of species are likely to survive in the specific area and adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions (i.e., environmental filtering). Moreover, functional traits like common currency linking different scales (e.g., phenotypic, ecological or metabolic). I am also crazy about the remote sensing approach as it is convenient to investigate on a large scale.
