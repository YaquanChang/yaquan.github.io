My research experience mainly refers to Macroecology, Remote Sensing, and ecological models. I focus on the selection process, asking how humans impact functional diversity. I am familiar with R, Matlab, and have some basic knowledge of Fortran.

### Human impacts on functional diversity
In my master thesis, I am going to investigate human impacts on functional diversity. Before my master thesis, I did a project out of course scope to investigate a similar question but only based on Gribskov, Denmark. I used LiDAR and field derived variables to capture the functional diversity of woody plants and found that LiDAR-derived variables perform slightly better than field measurements.

#### Output:
**Yaquan Chang**. LiDAR-derived variables as a proxy for functional diversity of woody plant and response to forest management intensity, 2019, _Project out of course scope_ 

### What else can species distribution model tell us?
I wrote my bachelors thesis and a paper (in revision) to investigate whether modeled habitat suitability could explain structural characteristics in a balsam fir dominated stand. I used species distribution models to simulate habitat suitability and related this to field-based site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG).

### An Upgraded Action Plan for invasive species
During my masters Rural Landscape course, my group and I created an Upgraded Action Plan for the invasive species Giant Hogweed in Vordingborg Municipality. We used species distribution models to simulate where is suitable for Giant Hogweed to grow then did fieldwork to validate the model. Finally, we made a practical action plan to eradicate them.

#### Output
**Yaquan Chang**, Alfred Figueras Anton, Oriol García Antúnez, Andreas Davidsen, Jens Lindgaard. 2019. How to upgrade current management plans for the invasive species Giant Hogweed in Denmark – a case study from Vordingborg municipality, Zealand. The Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) Scientific Student Conference. Uppsala, Sweden (Poster presentation) and paper (In prep)


### Remote Sensing including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
I am crazy about the Remote Sensing approach as it’s really convenient for researchers investigating at a larger scale. I have used LiDAR and UAV products, including using LiDAR-derived variables to predict functional diversity (see the first topic). I have also learnt about using UAVs through comparing the performance of different platforms for processing UAV data.

#### Output

Analysis of Imagine Capacity in Resources Survey between Two UAV Photogrammetry Softwares: PIX 4D Mapper and Photoscan. Gansu Science and Technology. 33(22): 46-51 (In Chinese) [(PDF)](https://yaquanchang.github.io/UAV_Paper.pdf)


### Forest dynamics
I learnt the basic concept of the forest dynamic models when I was an undergraduate student. I ran a process-based dynamic global vegetation model called Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ model) and calculated water use efficiency (WUE) of the forest in the Yangtze River basin, China.

#### Output
Special Award of 14th International Junior Forest Contest, Russian Federal Forest Agency
