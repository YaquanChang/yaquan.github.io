I am currently a master canadidate in Nature Management at University of Copenhagen. I broadly interested in plant biogeography, macroecology in Anthropocene! Now I am working on how land use intensity have impact on the plant functional diversity in Europe. I am trying to investigate how human play roles in selection process. I am using taxon-free methods based on functional traits, since taxon-free metrics could help understanding which kinds of species are likely to survive in the specific area and adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions (i.e., environmental filtering). Besides, functional traits like common currency linking different scales (e.g., phenotypic, ecological or metabolic).
